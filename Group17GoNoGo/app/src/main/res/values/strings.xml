        Welcome to the Go-No-Go test!  Once the game begins, you will
        be prompted with either a \"Go\" or \"No Go\" event.  You should tap as fast as possible for
        \"Go,\" and make sure not to tap the screen when \"No Go\" appears.  When the trial is finished,
        you\'ll be able to see a breakdown of your score and, if you are logged in, how you compare
        to other users!

    <string name="ReactionTest_instructions">
        This is a simple reaction test.  When the lower section of the screen flashes GREEN, tap as
        quickly as you can!  If you don\'t react in time, the screen will flash RED.
        When ready to play, click the button in the middle of the play area!
