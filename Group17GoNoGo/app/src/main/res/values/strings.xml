        Welcome to the Go-No-Go test!  Once the test begins, you will
        be prompted with either a \"Go\" or \"No Go\" event.  Tap as fast as possible for
        \"Go,\" and make sure NOT to tap the screen when \"No Go\" appears.  When the trial is finished,
        you\'ll be able to see a breakdown of your score and, if you\'re logged in, how you compare
        to other users!

        quickly as you can!  If you don\'t react in time, the screen will flash RED.
